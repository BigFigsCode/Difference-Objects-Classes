Classes are essentially blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define a set of properties and behaviors that every object created from the class will have. 
Think of a class as a sketch of a house that outlines the structure, design, and functionalities. This sketch dictates that every house built from it will have the same 
foundational design, number of rooms, and functionalities, although each house can have its own unique characteristics, like color or interior decorations.

Objects, on the other hand, are instances of classes. When a class is used to create an object, it's like building a house from the blueprint. The object inherits all 
the properties and behaviors defined by its class but also has the capacity to possess individual characteristics.
In our house analogy, one object might represent a blue house with modern decorations, while another object might represent a red house with vintage decorations. 
Despite these differences, both objects share the same foundational structure dictated by their class.

The conceptual difference between the two lies in their roles and abstraction levels. A class operates at a higher level of abstraction. It's a general concept 
that defines potential states and behaviors but doesn't represent anything concrete on its own. A class tells you what information and methods any object created 
from it will have, but it doesn't contain any actual data itself.
